# The Command-line interface

One of the core competencies of programmers is familiarity with something called [the command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface). The command line is a text-based interface for working with the computer. The "command" part refers to a user typing in what kind of task she wants the computer to perform. Using the command line provides a keyboard-drive way to perform tasks we have become accustomed to handling using modern graphical interfaces. On the command line, you can create and delete files, list the contents of a folder (a.k.a directory), fetch information from the internet, and open programs.

FIXME: Too jargony? Think about how much an audience needs to know.

## Word soup

We often use the phrases *command line*, *shell*, [*Bash*](abbr:Bourne Again Shell) and *terminal* interchangably. Essentially, a *terminal* is an interface to a *shell* which provides a *command line* and *Bash* is popular *shell* implementation (in the sense that Firefox is a browser implementation). So someone may ask you to "open a shell" or "open a terminal" or "go to the command line", and they typically mean the same thing.

## What does the command line look like?
