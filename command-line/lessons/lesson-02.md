Lesson 02 Outline

- Making directories, making files
    - Activity: mkdir and touch and mv

# Working with directories and files

So far we've created files using output redirection (`>`). Now it's time to create new directories and empty files.

## Activity: Working with directories and files

Have students do the [Working with directories and files](../activities/files-directories-crud.md) activity. They will learn `mkdir`, `touch`, and `mv`, as well as learn about hidden files, and output redirection that appends to a file rather than overwrites it.
