# What is the "Command line"?

One of the core competencies of programmers is familiarity with something called [the command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface). The command line is a text-based interface for working with the computer. The "command" part refers to a user typing in what kind of task she wants the computer to perform. Using the command line provides a keyboard-drive way to perform tasks we have become accustomed to handling using modern graphical interfaces (GUIs). On the command line, you can do things such as create and delete files, list the contents of a folder (a.k.a directory), fetch information from the internet, and open programs. You can even combine multiple actions into a sequence, making the command line a powerful and flexible environment for getting things done. That's why programmers often prefer the command line to GUIs!

## Word soup

We often use the phrases *command line*, *shell*, [*Bash*](abbr:Bourne Again Shell) and *terminal* interchangably. Essentially, a *terminal* is an interface to a *shell* which provides a *command line* and *Bash* is popular *shell* implementation (in the sense that Firefox is a browser implementation). So someone may ask you to "open a shell" or "open a terminal" or "go to the command line", and they typically mean the same thing. A thesaurus of some of these transposable terms is available at AA-thesaurus.md.
